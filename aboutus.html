        in their lives. Msichana Imara Foundation, not only promotes girls right

        <p>Msichana Imara Foundation is a non-governmental organization founded in 2019 by Eliwilimina Buberwa, who is
          now the organization's executive director. Growing up in a small village in the Shinyanga region of Tanzania,
          Eliwilimina experienced the prevalence of violence against women and girls and saw firsthand how girls were
          often denied their right to education. However, her late father believed in gender equality and equal access
          to education for all, which allowed Eliwilimina to attend school and eventually pursue a bachelor's degree in
          education.</p>
        <p>While in school, Eliwilimina started helping girls from her village access sponsorship opportunities for
          education, and over 35 girls benefited from her program. In 2019, she decided to register Msichana Imara
          Foundation as a non-governmental organization. Despite having a paying teaching job, Eliwilimina quit to focus
          all her time and efforts on ensuring that girls in Tanzania get their rights to education.</p>
        <p>Through her work at Msichana Imara Foundation, Eliwilimina has received numerous awards and recognitions for
          her efforts in promoting girls' rights in Tanzania. In 2021, she gave her first TEDx talk where she shared her
          journey of bringing up the organization from a dream to a reality. The foundation's mission is to empower
          women and girls through sustainable menstrual solutions, entrepreneurship training, and reproductive education
          programs</p>
