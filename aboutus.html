            <h1> Our story</h1>
            <pre> Msichana Imara Foundation is a non-governmental organization founded in 
                2019 by Eliwilimina Buberwa, who is now the organization's executive director.
                 Growing up in a small village in the Shinyanga region of Tanzania, 
                 Eliwilimina experienced the prevalence of violence against women and girls 
                 and saw firsthand how girls were often denied their right to education. However, 
                 her late father believed in gender equality and equal access to education for all, 
                 which allowed Eliwilimina to attend school 
                and eventually pursue a bachelor's degree in education.</pre>
            <pre>While in school, Eliwilimina started helping girls from her village access 
             sponsorship opportunities for education, and over 35 girls benefited from her program.
             In 2019, she decided to register Msichana Imara Foundation as a non-governmental 
            organization. Despite having a paying teaching job, Eliwilimina quit to focus all 
            her time and efforts on 
             ensuring that girls in Tanzania get their rights to education.</pre>
             <pre>Through her work at Msichana Imara Foundation, Eliwilimina has received numerous awards 
                and recognitions for her efforts in promoting girls' rights in Tanzania. 
                In 2021, she gave her first TEDx talk where she shared her journey of bringing up the 
                organization from a dream to a reality. The foundation's mission is to empower women 
                and girls through sustainable menstrual solutions, entrepreneurship training, 
                and reproductive education programs</pre>
