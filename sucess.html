<p>I first started making mawimbi reusable sanitary pads, In 2019, in a workshop conducted by 
     Msichana Imara Foundation at Sinoni, I was able to make 6 pads for myself, 
    and another 6 for my daughter. As a single mother, these pads have been of great 
    help to me since I do not have to spend more money on buying sanitary pads for me or for
    my daughter. On top of that, Mawimbi project has employed me to make pads for other girls. I use this opportunity to serve my community
     but also to get some money which helps me a lot to run my family</p>

        <p>I attended the mawimbi workshop, which trained me on how to make reusable pads at a workshop conducted in Engo Sheraton. On the first day I made 2 pads, then the next day I made 4 other pads. I have been using this skill to teach other girls in my community how they can make their own reusable pads. As a small entrepreneur, 
    the pads have helped me to save a lot of money which I hardly get</p>

        <p>I sincerely thank the Msichana Imara Foundation for visiting Maruvango secondary school. Through their visit, I learned about topics related to menstruation, puberty, and how to keep my body clean. I first thought that it was not good to talk about these topics but through the Mawimbi project, I can now confidently talk and also teach other students. Also, Mawimbi project  taught us, on how we can make reusable pads through local materials available in our environment, this has helped me to maintain my personal hygiene 
        during my menses and reduced risks to diseases</p>

        <p>We were so happy to host Mawimbi project in our school,
         It was once very had for our girls to access information regarded to 
         menstruation and reproduction, since regardless to the fact that our 
         school is having more 345 girls we only have 1 female teacher, 
         which makes it difficult for girls to get help especially on matters related to Menstruation. The visit of Mawimbi tour helped our students, especially girls, to understand more about menstruation and to make their own pads using local materials in our surroundings. We believe that the school attendance for girls will improve and they will be more
         confident in participating in  school activities</p>

        <p>The first argument is to save money and then to protect our health. It's interesting to do a workshop between women and to learn a skill to pass on to other girls. These reusable pads are good because they are natural, there is nothing artificial, and it is better for our health. We know how they are made and we can wash them ourselves. I consider this reusable periodic pad more hygienic; I like to be able to clean it myself. 
    It's very easy to wash and dry. </p>
